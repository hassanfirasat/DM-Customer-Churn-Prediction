mean = array([  64.79820819, 2283.30044084])
std = array([  30.08383459, 2266.61018071])

The standard score of a sample x is calculated as:

z = (x - u) / s

where u is the mean of the training samples or zero if with_mean=False, and s is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if with_std=False.
